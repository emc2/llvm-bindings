Simple LLVM bindings library for Haskell.  Contains raw FFI bindings,
as well as more Haskell-friendly versions.

Bindings are created against the LLVM C bindings primarily.

Version major and minor numbers track the primary LLVM release
targeted by the library.  Backwards compatibility against previous
LLVM versions depends primarily on whether or not LLVM itself
guarantees such compatibility.

This release focuses on providing an interface to LLVM as a compiler
backend.  Disassembly and object file features, link-time
optimization, and the execution engine are not supported in this
version.  Support is planned for later versions.


At present, this doesn't seem to work in GHCI, due to missing C++
arcana; however, standalone applications seem to compile just fine.

This has been tested on FreeBSD at present, but no other platforms.

This code was derived in part from Bryan O'Sullivan's llvm Haskell
library.
